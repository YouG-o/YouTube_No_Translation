/**
 * Handles YouTube's audio track selection to force original language
 * 
 * YouTube stores audio tracks in a specific format:
 * - Each track has an ID in the format: "251;BASE64_ENCODED_DATA"
 * - The BASE64_ENCODED_DATA contains track information including language code
 * - Track data is encoded as: "acont" (audio content) + "original"/"dubbed-auto" + "lang=XX-XX"
 * - Original track can be identified by "original" in its decoded data
 * 
 * Example of track ID:
 * "251;ChEKBWFjb250EghvcmlnaW5hbAoNCgRsYW5nEgVlbi1VUw"
 * When decoded: Contains "original" for original audio and "lang=en-US" for language
