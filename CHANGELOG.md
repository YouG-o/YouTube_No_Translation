## [Unreleased]

## [2.4.1] - 2025-06-18

### Fixed
- Prevented main video settings from being skipped when a description or title fallback is triggered: video events from isolated players are now ignored, eliminating the need for global timeouts or flags and ensuring correct behavior when switching videos rapidly.

## [2.4.0] - 2025-06-18

### Added
- **BETA Player API Fallback for Browsing Titles**: New experimental fallback system using YouTube Player API when oEmbed fails to retrieve original titles
  - Smart retry mechanism with ynt-fail-retry attribute for videos that initially fail
  - Dedicated popup setting (disabled by default) with clear BETA labeling
  - Player readiness detection to handle cases where player loads after initial page load
  - Sequential delay system to prevent API rate limiting
- **BETA Search Results Description Replacement**: New experimental feature to replace translated descriptions in search results with original versions (may impact performance as it requires video player interactions)
  - Smart filtering: only processes videos already identified as translated by title system
  - Dedicated popup setting (disabled by default) with clear BETA labeling
- **Current Chapter Button Replacement**: Replace translated chapter text in the current chapter button displayed in video player
- **Isolated YouTube Player System**: New architecture using separate iframe-based YouTube players for metadata retrieval
  - Prevents video playback interruption when retrieving metadata on video watch pages
  - Parameterizable player ID system supporting multiple isolated players simultaneously
  - Dedicated players for different features (ynt-player-titles, ynt-player-descriptions)
  - Eliminates concurrency issues between browsing titles and search descriptions features

### Fixed
- **Concatenated Titles Display**: Fixed issue where original and translated titles would appear concatenated due to DOM element reuse
  - Enhanced cleanup logic to remove all previous attributes and spans before applying new ones
  - Improved detection of stale direct text nodes in browsing title elements
  - Better handling of YouTube's DOM recycling during navigation
- **Optimized Title Processing**: Prevent unnecessary API calls by checking ynt attributes before making requests
  - Individual video processing tracking to prevent duplicate processing
  - Improved throttling system to prevent concurrent executions

### Technical Improvements
- Enhanced chapter replacement system with video player time detection
- Added mutation observer for current chapter button changes
- Improved video time retrieval using direct video element access
- Strengthened title element cleanup process to prevent content accumulation
- Added browsing titles fallback script with player API integration
- Implemented retry system for failed title requests with proper cleanup
- Created isolated player creation system with page context injection
- Added utility functions for isolated player management (create, ensure, cleanup)
- Updated fallback scripts to use isolated players instead of main player

## [2.3.20] - 2025-06-17

### Added
- User interaction detection to prevent overriding manual settings changes when user modifies YouTube player settings

### Changed
- Unified video player event listeners into a single robust system for better reliability and performance
- Enhanced video detection with comprehensive fallback events (timeupdate, seeked) to handle edge cases where videos load faster than listeners
- Implemented adaptive event optimization that reduces from 7 to 2 events after initial trigger

### Technical Improvements
- Refactored separate directLoadListener and loadStartListener into unified videoPlayerListener
- Added proper cleanup mechanism for all possible event types to prevent orphaned listeners
- Improved timing race condition handling for videos that start playing before listeners are attached
- Added click detection on YouTube settings menu with 2-second timeout to allow user to manually change audio track, or other settings without the add-on trying to reapply its own settings.

## [2.3.13] - 2025-06-16

### Added
- Display a welcome page on first extension installation.

### Changed
- Automatically refresh open YouTube and YouTube No-Cookie tabs upon first extension installation.

## [2.3.12] - 2025-06-14

### Fixed
- Enhanced subtitle and audio language detection on direct video loads with unified fallback system using multiple detection methods for better reliability.

## [2.3.11] - 2025-06-14

### Fixed
- Improved chapter detection to handle emojis, bullet points, and various separators in video descriptions.
- Improved subtitle and audio language detection on direct video loads (refresh, new tab, direct links).

## [2.3.1] - 2025-06-12

### Changed
- Improved audio & subtitles languages preferences storage by using a consistent, prefixed keys (`ynt-audioLanguage` & `ynt-subtitlesLanguage`) in localStorage to prevent conflicts and ensure reliability.

### Fixed
