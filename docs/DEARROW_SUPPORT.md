# Compatibility with DeArrow

If you use the [DeArrow](https://github.com/ajayyy/DeArrow) extension alongside YouTube No Translation, both extensions may try to modify video titles, which can cause conflicts.

**Recommended settings for best compatibility:**
- In DeArrow, enable **"Only format user-submitted titles"**.
- Do **not** enable **"Remove Emojis"** in DeArrow.

With these settings, YouTube No Translation will restore original (non-translated) titles, and DeArrow will only format or replace titles that have been submitted by users (and thoses ones are ignored by YNT).

If you experience issues, please check your DeArrow settings or temporarily disable one of the extensions.
